# CabLab Tasks/Surveys
This repository is dedicated to storing experimental tasks, surveys, and analysis pipelines generated by the CabLab at Temple University.

To view our tasks/surveys, you can view [interactive demos](https://tucablab.github.io/cablab/) for each task or survey. If you prefer to view the code directly, check out our [task directory](https://github.com/TUcablab/cablab/tree/main/tasks/) or [survey directory](https://github.com/TUcablab/cablab/tree/main/surveys/)

Our repository was inspired by and modeled after the [Niv Lab jsPsych Demos page](https://nivlab.github.io/jspsych-demos/).

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages using the [Slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist).
